"""
on_message(message)
    A discord event function that is called whenever there is a message in the server.
    This is used to check to see if the message is a guild application. This is done by
    checking if the message starts with "ign", and that the message comes from a channel
    under the "apply here" category. Once it gets the app, it sends it to #guild-apps
    and #deleted-apps.

on_guild_channel_create(channel)
    A discord event function that is called whenever a new channel is created. This is
    used to check when a new ticket channel has been created, and send a bot message to
    that channel (informing them about guild information).
